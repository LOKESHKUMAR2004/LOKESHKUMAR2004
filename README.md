Bus Management System

In the era of growing urbanization and rapid transportation demands, managing bus schedules manually has become an increasingly challenging and error-prone task. Manual processes often lead to inefficiencies such as mismanagement of schedules, overlapping routes, and delays in decision-making. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for a digital Bus Management System that simplifies the management of bus records while ensuring accuracy, ease of use, and scalability.
The problem at hand is to develop a functional software solution for bus management that allows users to manage key details of buses, such as bus numbers, route names, in-times, and out-times. The system should be equipped with essential features like adding, updating, and deleting bus records, sorting schedules based on specific criteria, and displaying them in an organized manner. By replacing manual operations with a structured digital approach, this system will enable better planning and operational efficiency, ultimately improving transportation management.
Problem Scope:
1.	Data Management: The system must maintain a repository of bus-related information, including:
o	Bus Number: Unique identifier for each bus.
o	Route Name: Designated route or path of the bus.
o	In-Time and Out-Time: Schedule details for bus arrival and departure.
2.	Core Operations: Users should be able to:
o	Add Records: Create new bus entries with complete details.
o	Update Records: Modify details of existing buses, such as route changes or updated timings.
o	Delete Records: Remove outdated or unnecessary bus entries.
o	View Records: Display all buses in an organized and user-friendly format.
3.	Sorting and Filtering: The system must allow users to dynamically sort records based on:
o	In-Time: Organize buses by their arrival times.
o	Out-Time: Organize buses by their departure times.
o	Sorting should support both ascending and descending orders based on user preference.
4.	Error Handling: The system should incorporate robust mechanisms to handle common errors, such as:
o	Preventing duplicate or incomplete bus records.
o	Validating updates to ensure consistency.
o	Avoiding invalid operations, such as deleting non-existent entries.
5.	User Interface: The system should have an intuitive and interactive interface where users can navigate through operations effortlessly. Prompts should guide users to input data correctly and make informed choices.

Objectives:
•	Efficient Record Management: To provide a digital platform where users can manage all bus-related data efficiently, reducing errors and improving operational reliability.
•	Dynamic Sorting: To allow users to sort bus records based on specific attributes (e.g., in-time, out-time) in real-time, enabling better schedule planning.
•	User-Centric Design: To create a system that is easy to use, with clear instructions and logical workflows for managing data.
•	Data Integrity: To ensure that the system maintains accuracy and consistency in bus records through proper validation and error handling.

Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a Bus Management System that serves as a digital replacement for manual record-keeping, offering features such as:
•	Adding, Updating, and Deleting Records: Users can easily manage bus schedules with minimal effort.
•	Sorting and Displaying Data: The system enables users to sort schedules based on timing criteria, making it easier to plan operations or track specific buses.
•	Accurate Data Management: The system ensures that all data entered is validated and maintained consistently.
•	Scalable Design: While focusing on basic operations, the system is designed to allow future extensions, such as real-time tracking or multi-route mapping.

Expected Outcomes:
By implementing this project, the Bus Management System will streamline the process of managing bus schedules and enhance the overall efficiency of transportation services. The system will serve as a foundational model for more complex transportation management software, such as passenger tracking or dynamic route allocation. This project highlights the practical integration of structured data management and user-friendly design to solve real-world problems in the transportation domain.









METHODOLOGY


To develop a Bus Management System, the methodology is structured around software engineering best practices, encompassing planning, design, implementation, and testing. This systematic approach ensures the development of a robust, user-friendly application for managing bus schedules and operations.
________________________________________
1. Requirement Gathering
The first step involved identifying the core functionalities and features required for the Bus Management System. Key requirements include:
•	Data Management: The ability to add, update, delete, and view bus records.
•	Sorting and Filtering: Dynamic sorting of buses by in-time and out-time in ascending or descending order.
•	User Interface: A menu-driven interface for intuitive navigation and user interaction.
•	Error Handling: Validation mechanisms to prevent errors such as duplicate records or invalid inputs.
•	Extensibility: A design that allows the system to accommodate future features like real-time tracking or analytics.

2. System Design
The design phase focused on creating a modular structure following object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability. The system consists of the following components:
•	Bus Class:
o	Purpose: Stores individual bus details such as bus number, route name, in-time, and out-time.
o	Methods: Includes getters, setters, and methods to validate the bus data.
•	BusManagementSystem Class:
o	Purpose: Acts as the core of the application, handling operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and sorting bus records.
o	Responsibilities:
	Manage the list of buses.
	Implement sorting logic for in-time and out-time.
	Provide methods for user interaction and input handling.
•	Validation and Exceptions:
o	Introduced validation checks for user inputs to ensure consistency.
o	Custom exceptions, such as InvalidBusRecordException, handle invalid or duplicate entries.

3. System Implementation
The implementation phase involved translating the design into working Java code. Key features were implemented as follows:
1.	Adding, Updating, and Deleting Bus Records:
o	Users can add a new bus with complete details.
o	Existing records can be updated to reflect schedule or route changes.
o	Obsolete or invalid records can be deleted.
2.	Sorting Bus Records:
o	Implemented sorting logic to arrange buses by in-time or out-time.
o	Provided options for ascending and descending order based on user preferences.
3.	User Interface:
o	Developed a menu-driven console application to facilitate user interaction.
o	Each operation is accessible through a simple menu, prompting users for input at each step.
4.	Error Handling:
o	Ensured data integrity by validating inputs and preventing invalid actions (e.g., deleting a non-existent record) 
o	Implemented safeguards to avoid duplicate entries or incomplete records.

4. Testing
Testing was conducted to ensure the system’s functionality, accuracy, and reliability. The following scenarios were covered:
•	Input Validation: Tested with invalid or incomplete inputs to ensure the system rejects them gracefully.
•	Sorting Logic: Verified sorting functionality for in-time and out-time in both ascending and descending orders.
•	Edge Cases: Tested scenarios such as adding a bus with conflicting timings or attempting to update a non-existent record.
•	User Interaction: Ensured the menu-driven interface responds appropriately to user inputs and guides users through each operation.
Manual testing with diverse inputs was carried out to simulate real-world usage, and edge cases were evaluated to verify robustness.
